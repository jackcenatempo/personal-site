## What am I up to?
I'm a first-year PhD student in Economics at Columbia University. Currently, I'm learning as much macro/microeconomic theory, econometrics, and mathematics as I possibly can.

Before that, I was a Predoctoral Research Fellow with the Economics and Computation group at Microsoft Research New England. 
- If you're curious about [E&C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/economics-and-computation/overview/): "Economics informs what outcomes algorithms can compute in the presence of self-motivated individuals. Computer science offers a theory of complexity and approximation, thereby both imposing realistic constraints on the space of solutions and relaxing the metric by which we judge them. Together, these interdisciplinary researchers can design and build markets and platforms with robust and socially desirable properties." 
- If you're curious about MSR, you can find out more [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/). I was a member of the New England Research and Development Center (NERD). It's a unique, interdisciplinary lab where I interacted and collaborated with experts on sociotechnical systems, cryptography, the biological sciences, sphere packing, and more.

## What am I interested in?
- I'd call myself an aspiring [applied microeconomist](https://economics.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/areas-study/applied-microeconomics#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20data%20and,%2C%20health%2C%20and%20environmental%20economics.), but my interests are still broad.
- Currently, I'm interested in online platforms and the role of technology companies/technological innovation in the acquisiton of employment and health care/information. I'm also interested in the role of automation and generative AI in the job search and hiring processes.

## What's my background?
- I'm originally from Atlanta, Georgia. That's right; there's a city outside of the airport.
<!-- If you're not familiar, that means I grew up inside the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, attended kindergarten inside a Waffle House, and have Diet Coke instead of blood.  -->
- I attended the University of Georgia in Athens, arguably the best college town in the country. 
- I moved to Greater Boston in June of 2022 to start my work with MSR.
- In August of 2024, I moved to New York City to start my PhD at Columbia.

## What else do I like?
- seasonal produce, elaborate meal-prepping, and overpriced coffee
- running, hiking, and public transportation
- supporting local businesses (If you'd like, check out [my list of favorites](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H7oksnWnH5hFx5cq8).)
