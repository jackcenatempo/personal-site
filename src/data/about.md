## What am I up to?
I currently am a first-year PhD student in Economics at Columbia University. I moved to Morningisde Heights in August 2024 and quickly got to studying! I'm working away at coursework in microeconomic theory, macroeconomic theory, econometrics, and mathematics.

Before that, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Assistant with the Economics and Computation group at Microsoft Research New England. 
- If you're curious about [E&C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/economics-and-computation/overview/): "Economics informs what outcomes algorithms can compute in the presence of self-motivated individuals. Computer science offers a theory of complexity and approximation, thereby both imposing realistic constraints on the space of solutions and relaxing the metric by which we judge them. Together, these interdisciplinary researchers can design and build markets and platforms with robust and socially desirable properties." 
- If you're curious about [MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/): This is the organization within Microsoft in which I work. I specifically belong to the New England Research and Development Center (NERD). It's an interdisciplinary research lab where I've been able to interact with experts on biological sciences, sociotechnical systems, cryptography, sphere packing, and more.

## What am I interested in?
- I'd call myself an aspiring [applied microeconomist](https://economics.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/areas-study/applied-microeconomics#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20data%20and,%2C%20health%2C%20and%20environmental%20economics.), but my interests are still broad.
- Currently, I'm interested in online platforms and the role of technology companies/technological innovation in the acquisiton of employment and health care/information.

## What's my background?
- I'm originally from Atlanta, Georgia. That's right; there's a city outside of the airport.
<!-- If you're not familiar, that means I grew up inside the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, attended kindergarten inside a Waffle House, and have Diet Coke instead of blood.  -->
- I attended the University of Georgia in Athens - arguably the best college town in the country. If you're ever in town, I must recommend Buvez for coffee, the World Famous for late-night food, Seabear Oyster Bar for a fun dinner, The Lark for a lovely glass of wine, and The Old Pal for a _stiff_ drink.
- I moved to Cambridge in June of 2022 to start as an RA at MSR. I lived in Somerville have an abundance of recommendations. Special local businesses: Momma's Grocery + Wine; Dave's Fresh Pasta. Dining: Cicada, Judy's Bay, Sarma, june bug, and Celeste. (Wine) Bars: Dear Annie, Backbar, Zuzu's Petals, and Nook.
- In August of 2024, I moved to New York City to start my PhD at Columbia.
