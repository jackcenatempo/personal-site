## What am I up to?
I'm a first-year PhD student in Economics at Columbia University. Currently, I'm immersing myself in macroeconomic and microeconomic theory, econometrics, and mathematics.

Before that, I was a Predoctoral Research Fellow with the Economics and Computation group at Microsoft Research New England. 
- If you're curious about [E&C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/economics-and-computation/overview/): "Economics informs what outcomes algorithms can compute in the presence of self-motivated individuals. Computer science offers a theory of complexity and approximation, thereby both imposing realistic constraints on the space of solutions and relaxing the metric by which we judge them. Together, these interdisciplinary researchers can design and build markets and platforms with robust and socially desirable properties." 
- If you're curious about MSR, you can find out more [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/). I was a member of the New England Research and Development Center (NERD). It's a unique, interdisciplinary lab where I interacted and collaborated with experts on sociotechnical systems, cryptography, the biological sciences, sphere packing, and more.

## What am I interested in?
- I consider myself an aspiring [applied microeconomist](https://economics.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/areas-study/applied-microeconomics#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20data%20and,%2C%20health%2C%20and%20environmental%20economics.), though my interests remain broad.
- For example, I'm interested in online platforms and the role of technological innovations in mediating access to employment, healthcare, and health information. I also hope to study how automation and generative AI influence both employers and potential employees in the hiring and job search processes.

## What's my background?
- I'm originally from Atlanta, Georgia. That's right; there's a city outside of the airport.
<!-- If you're not familiar, that means I grew up inside the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, attended kindergarten inside a Waffle House, and have Diet Coke instead of blood.  -->
- In 2022, I graduated from the University of Georgia in Athens, arguably the best college town in the country. 
- I then moved to Greater Boston to start my work with MSR.
- In August of 2024, I moved to New York City to start my PhD at Columbia.

## What else do I like?
- Seasonal produce, elaborate meal-prepping, and overpriced coffee
- Running, hiking, and public transportation
- Supporting local businesses (If you'd like, check out [my list of favorites](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H7oksnWnH5hFx5cq8).)
