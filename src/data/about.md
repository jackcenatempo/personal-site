# What I'm Up To

I'm currently a Pre-Doctoral Research Assistant with the Economics and Computation group at Microsoft Research New England. Let's break that down.
- _Pre-Doctoral_: I am in the stage of my career before earning a PhD. Sounds kind of presumptuous, right? If you think about it, anyone that doesn't have and isn't completing a PhD is in a pre-doctoral stage of his life. Well, I'm going to spin this to mean that I am hopeful that I'll (i) get into a program and (ii) complete it. I'll talk about the subject matter later.
- _Research Assistant_: I am helping people with PhD's do the thing that I want to do later. This involves a lot of reading, working with data, and taking copious notes. 
- _Economics and Computation_: This is the subject matter I mentioned earlier. I see myself more as an economics person, but the field lies at the intersection of the two. Here's a blurb from the group's website: " Economics informs what outcomes algorithms can compute in the presence of self-motivated individuals. Computer science offers a theory of complexity and approximation, thereby both imposing realistic constraints on the space of solutions and relaxing the metric by which we judge them. Together, these interdisciplinary researchers can design and build markets and platforms with robust and socially desirable properties." 
- _Microsoft Research_: The  organization within Microsoft in which I work. I specifically belong to the New England Research and Development Center (NERD). It's an interdisciplinary research space where I've been able to interact with work studying anything from biology to social media.
- _New England_: Where I live and have access to plentiful seafood and snow.
